(MNS) for magnetic resonance imaging applications.","createdDate":"201311012139","description":"The development of MRI contrast agents has experienced its version of the gilded age over the past decade, thanks largely to the rapid advances in nanotechnology. In addition to progress in single mode contrast agents, which ushered in unprecedented R(1) or R(2) sensitivities, there has also been a boon in the development of agents covering more than one mode of detection. These include T(1)-PET, T(2)-PET T(1)-optical, T(2)-optical, T(1)-T(2) agents and many others. In this review, we describe four areas which we feel have experienced particular growth due to nanotechnology, specifically T(2) magnetic nanostructure development, T(1)/T(2)-optical dual mode agents, and most recently the T(1)-T(2) hybrid imaging systems. In each of these systems, we describe applications including in vitro, in vivo usage and assay development. In all, while the benefits and drawbacks of most MRI contrast agents depend on the application at hand, the recent development in multimodal nanohybrids may curtail the shortcomings of single mode agents in diagnostic and clinical settings by synergistically incorporating functionality. It is hoped that as nanotechnology advances over the next decade, it will produce agents with increased diagnostics and assay relevant capabilities in streamlined packages that can meaningfully improve patient care and prognostics. In this review article, we focus on T(2) materials, its surface functionalization and coupling with optical and/or T(1) agents.","id":"39879268","pubmedId":"21851844","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"miRNA profiling of naïve, effector and memory CD8 T cells.","createdDate":"201004291902","description":"microRNAs have recently emerged as master regulators of gene expression during development and cell differentiation. Although profound changes in gene expression also occur during antigen-induced T cell differentiation, the role of miRNAs in the process is not known. We compared the miRNA expression profiles between antigen-specific naïve, effector and memory CD8+ T cells using 3 different methods--small RNA cloning, miRNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Although many miRNAs were expressed in all the T cell subsets, the frequency of 7 miRNAs (miR-16, miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-150, miR-15b and let-7f) alone accounted for approximately 60% of all miRNAs, and their expression was several fold higher than the other expressed miRNAs. Global downregulation of miRNAs (including 6/7 dominantly expressed miRNAs) was observed in effector T cells compared to naïve cells and the miRNA expression levels tended to come back up in memory T cells. However, a few miRNAs, notably miR-21 were higher in effector and memory T cells compared to naïve T cells. These results suggest that concomitant with profound changes in gene expression, miRNA profile also changes dynamically during T cell differentiation. Sequence analysis of the cloned mature miRNAs revealed an extensive degree of end polymorphism. While 3'end polymorphisms dominated, heterogeneity at both ends, resembling drosha/dicer processing shift was also seen in miR-142, suggesting a possible novel mechanism to generate new miRNA and/or to diversify miRNA target selection. Overall, our results suggest that dynamic changes in the expression of miRNAs may be important for the regulation of gene expression during antigen-induced T cell differentiation. Our study also suggests possible novel mechanisms for miRNA biogenesis and function.","id":"26346022","pubmedId":"17925868","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"In vivo quantification of T1, T2, and apparent diffusion coefficient in the mouse retina at 11.74T.","createdDate":"201004291858","description":"MRI has recently been used for noninvasive examination of retinal structure and function in rats and cats. However, the advantages of quantitative high-resolution MRI of retina from mice have not yet been explored. In the present study, T(1) and T(2) relaxation time constants and the directional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the retina of C57/BL6 mice were measured. Three MR-detected retina layers and a MR-detected choroid layer were observed on both T(1)- and T(2)-weighted images at an image resolution of 47 x 47 x 400 microm(3).

The summit revealed that this field is advancing rapidly. Conventional cellular therapies, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), are becoming more effective and more available. Gene therapy is becoming an important tool in adoptive cell therapy. Lymphocytes are being engineered to express high affinity T cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antibody-T cell receptors (CARs) and cytokines. T cell subsets with more naïve and stem cell-like characteristics have been shown in pre-clinical models to be more effective than unselected populations and it is now possible to reprogram T cells and to produce T cells with stem cell characteristics. In the future, combinations of adoptive transfer of T cells and specific vaccination against the cognate antigen can be envisaged to further enhance the effectiveness of these therapies.","id":"39878782","pubmedId":"22420641","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Modular nucleic acid assembled p/MHC microarrays for multiplexed sorting of antigen-specific T cells.","createdDate":"201004291848","description":"The human immune system consists of a large number of T cells capable of recognizing and responding to antigens derived from various sources. The development of peptide-major histocompatibility (p/MHC) tetrameric complexes has enabled the direct detection of these antigen-specific T cells. With the goal of increasing throughput and multiplexing of T cell detection, protein microarrays spotted with defined p/MHC complexes have been reported, but studies have been limited due to the inherent instability and reproducibility of arrays produced via conventional spotted methods. Herein, we report on a platform for the detection of antigen-specific T cells on glass substrates that offers significant advantages over existing surface-bound schemes. In this approach, called \"Nucleic Acid Cell Sorting (NACS)\", single-stranded DNA oligomers conjugated site-specifically to p/MHC tetramers are employed to immobilize p/MHC tetramers via hybridization to a complementary-printed substrate. Fully assembled p/MHC arrays are used to detect and enumerate T cells captured from cellular suspensions, including primary human T cells collected from cancer patients. NACS arrays outperform conventional spotted arrays assessed in key criteria such as repeatability and homogeneity. The versatility of employing DNA sequences for cell sorting is exploited to enable the programmed, selective release of target populations of immobilized T cells with restriction endonucleases for downstream analysis. Because of the performance, facile and modular assembly of p/MHC tetramer arrays, NACS holds promise as a versatile platform for multiplexed T cell detection.","id":"26345502","pubmedId":"19552409","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"A folate receptor-targeting nanoparticle minimizes drug resistance in a human cancer model.","createdDate":"201311012109","description":"Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle in cancer therapy. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of a folate receptor-targeting nanoparticle to overcome/minimize drug resistance and to explore the underlying mechanisms. This is accomplished with enhanced cellular accumulation and retention of paclitaxel (one of the most effective anticancer drugs in use today and a well-known P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate) in a P-gp-overexpressing cancer model. The folate receptor-targeted nanoparticle, HFT-T, consists of a heparin-folate-paclitaxel (HFT) backbone with an additional paclitaxel (T) loaded in its hydrophobic core. In vitro analyses demonstrated that the HFT-T nanoparticle was superior to free paclitaxel or nontargeted nanoparticle (HT-T) in inhibiting proliferation of P-gp-overexpressing cancer cells (KB-8-5), partially due to its enhanced uptake and prolonged intracellular retention. In a subcutaneous KB-8-5 xenograft model, HFT-T administration enhanced the specific delivery of paclitaxel into tumor tissues and remarkably prolonged retention within tumor tissues. Importantly, HFT-T treatment markedly retarded tumor growth in a xenograft model of resistant human squamous cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis further indicated that increased in vivo efficacy of HFT-T nanoparticles was associated with a higher degree of microtubule stabilization, mitotic arrest, antiangiogenic activity, and inhibition of cell proliferation. These findings suggest that when the paclitaxel was delivered as an HFT-T nanoparticle, the drug is better retained within the P-gp-overexpressing cells than the free form of paclitaxel. These results indicated that the targeted HFT-T nanoparticle may be promising in minimizing P-gp related drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic efficacy compared with the free form of paclitaxel.","id":"39879031","pubmedId":"21728341","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Suppression of leukemia development caused by PTEN loss.","createdDate":"201311012134","description":"Multiple genetic or molecular alterations are known to be associated with cancer stem cell formation and cancer development. Targeting such alterations, therefore, may lead to cancer prevention. By crossing our previously established phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten)-null acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model onto the recombination-activating gene 1(-/-) background, we show that the lack of variable, diversity and joining [V(D)J] recombination completely abolishes the Tcr?/?-c-myc translocation and T-ALL development, regardless of ?-catenin activation. We identify mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a regulator of ?-selection. Rapamycin, an mTOR-specific inhibitor, alters nutrient sensing and blocks T-cell differentiation from CD4(-)CD8(-) to CD4(+)CD8(+), the stage where the Tcr?/?-c-myc translocation occurs. Long-term rapamycin treatment of preleukemic Pten-null mice prevents Tcr?/?-c-myc translocation and leukemia stem cell (LSC) formation, and it halts T-ALL development. However, rapamycin alone fails to inhibit mTOR signaling in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) population enriched for LSCs and eliminate these cells. Our results support the idea that preventing LSC formation and selectively targeting LSCs are promising approaches for antileukemia therapies.","id":"39879226","pubmedId":"21212363","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for tumor imaging and therapy","createdDate":"201004291853","description":"Magnetic iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles with a long blood retention time, biodegradability and low toxicity have emerged as one of the primary nanomaterials for biomedical applications in vitro and in vivo.

Therefore, instead of focusing exclusively on the investigation of molecular mechanisms in cancer cells, convection-diffusion of cytotoxic molecules and migration of cancer-killing cells within tumor tissue should be taken into account to improve therapeutic effectiveness. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a mathematical model of the interstitial diffusion and uptake of small cytotoxic molecules secreted by T-cells, which is capable of predicting breast cancer growth inhibition as measured both in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis shows that diffusion barriers of cytotoxic molecules conspire with ?? T-cell scarcity in tissue to limit the inhibitory effects of ?? T-cells on cancer cells. This may increase the necessary ratios of ?? T-cells to cancer cells within tissue to unrealistic values for having an intended therapeutic effect, and decrease the effectiveness of the immunotherapeutic treatment.","id":"39878694","pubmedId":"23620747","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Luminescent silica nanobeads: characterization and evaluation as efficient cytoplasmatic transporters for T-lymphocytes.","createdDate":"201004291905","description":"We report the fabrication and characterization of neutravidin-conjugated silica nanobeads doped with a ruthenium-complex luminophore and functionalized with antihuman CD3, antihuman CD28, and an acid-sensitive polymer.

The main challenges in cancer biology are to identify cancer stem cells and to define the molecular events required for transforming normal cells to cancer stem cells. Here we show that Pten deletion in mouse haematopoietic stem cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Self- renewable leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) compartment, where unphosphorylated beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one allele of the beta-catenin gene substantially decreases the incidence and delays the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss, indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to the formation or expansion of the LSC population. Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, T(14;15), results in aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit mid CD3(+)Lin(-) LSCs and CD3(+) leukaemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signalling are detected in this model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities(2,3), leading to T-ALL development.

By applying a multivariate intracellular phospho-proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that LFA-1 differentially activates signaling molecules. RESULTS: Signal intensity was dependent on both ICAM ligand and LFA-1 concentration. In the presence of CD3 and CD28 stimulation, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 decreased TGFbeta1 production more than ICAM-1. In long-term differentiation experiments, stimulation with ICAM-3, CD3, and CD28 generated IFNgamma producing CD4+CD45RO+CD62L-CD11aBrightCD27- cells that had increased expression of intracellular BCL2, displayed distinct chemokine receptor profiles, and exhibited distinct migratory characteristics. Only CD3/CD28 with ICAM-3 generated CD4+CD45RO+CD62L-CD11aBrightCD27- cells that were functionally responsive to chemotaxis and exhibited higher frequencies of cells that signaled to JNK and ERK1/2 upon stimulation with MIP3alpha. Furthermore, these reports identify that the LFA-1 receptor, when presented with multiple ligands, can result in distinct T cell differentiation states and suggest that the combinatorial integration of ICAM ligand interactions with LFA-1 have functional consequences for T cell biology. CONCLUSION: Thus, the ICAM ligands, differentially modulate LFA-1 signaling in T cells and potentiate the development of memory human T cells in vitro. These findings are of importance in a mechanistic understanding of memory cell differentiation and ex vivo generation of memory cell subsets for therapeutic applications.","id":"26346228","pubmedId":"17233909","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Multi-reservoir device for detecting a soluble cancer biomarker.","createdDate":"201004291902","description":"By combining the sensing capabilities of nanoscale magnetic relaxation switches (MRS) within multi-reservoir structures, a potentially powerful implantable multiplexed sensor has been developed.

Because microbes or microbial constituents are powerful adjuvants to stimulate immune responses, we evaluated whether intratumoral administration of a highly immunogenic but attenuated parasite could induce rejection of an established poorly immunogenic tumor. We treated intradermal B16F10 murine melanoma by intratumoral injection of an attenuated strain of Toxoplasma gondii (cps) that cannot replicate in vivo and therefore is not infective. The cps treatment stimulated a strong CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in vivo that regressed established primary melanoma. The cps monotherapy rapidly modified the tumor microenvironment, halting tumor growth, and subsequently, as tumor-reactive T cells expanded, the tumors disappeared and rarely returned. The treatment required live cps that could invade cells and also required CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, but did not require CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-12, IFN-?, and the CXCR3-stimulating cytokines are required for full treatment efficacy. The treatment developed systemic antitumor immune activity as well as antitumor immune memory and therefore might have an impact against human metastatic disease. The approach is not specific for either B16F10 or melanoma. Direct intratumoral injection of cps has efficacy against an inducible genetic melanoma model and transplantable lung and ovarian tumors, demonstrating potential for broad clinical use. The combination of efficacy, systemic antitumor immune response, and complete attenuation with no observed host toxicity demonstrates the potential value of this novel cancer therapy.","id":"39878698","pubmedId":"23225891","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"T?-weighted ultrashort echo time method for positive contrast imaging of magnetic nanoparticles and cancer cells bound with the targeted nanoparticles.","createdDate":"201311012104","description":"UTE imaging allows for imaging of IONPs and IONP bound tumor cells with positive contrast and provides contrast enhancement and potential quantification of IONPs in molecular imaging applications.","id":"39878995","pubmedId":"21182139","fileId":null,"fileTitle":null,"editable":false}];
