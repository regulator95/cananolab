	* liposome -- Substances composed of layers of lipid that form hollow microscopic spheres within which drugs or agents could be contained for enhanced safety and efficacy.                A small, stable particle whose size is measured in nanometers. These particles are used in various biomedical applications in which they can be utilized as drug carriers or imaging agents. Various targeting agents, such as antibodies, drugs, imaging agents, and reporters can be attached to the surface of a nanoparticle.
